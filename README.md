# The Software Project in Emerging Platforms 
In this repository you will find the folllowing:

Code for pages that are made using WPF(Windows Presentation Foundation)
Code for Machine Learning that uses Microsofts ML.NET(Microsofts Machine Learning that uses .NET)

# Why did we use a WPF
At the time, the use of WPF was the easiest medium that my entire group understood how to use. We also were not looking to deploy our code so WPF was the best option for the our project

# What is ML.NET

ML.NET is short for Machine Learning.NET. It is a free machine learning library for Microsofts Visual Studio 2022. It does all the set up for the creation of a Machine learning object. With my groups minimal knowledge of Machine Learning we decided that it would be best if we use a library instead of coding an entire Machine Learning object by ourself.
